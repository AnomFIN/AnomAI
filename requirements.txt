# ============================================================================
# AnomAI/JugiAI Requirements
# ============================================================================
#
# This file contains the Python package dependencies for AnomAI/JugiAI.
# The application is designed to work with minimal dependencies using Python's
# standard library (tkinter, json, urllib, etc.).
#
# REQUIRED:
# - Python 3.10+ (64-bit)
# - tkinter (usually included with Python on Windows)
#
# OPTIONAL:
# - Pillow: Recommended for improved image handling (watermarks, backgrounds, icons)
# - llama-cpp-python: For local GGUF/LLM model support (installed separately by install.bat)
#
# ============================================================================

# Image processing library (optional but recommended)
# Enables better watermark/background image handling and icon generation
# Supports Python 3.9+ by allowing older Pillow versions (8.x works with Python 3.9)
pillow>=8.0.0

# Note: llama-cpp-python is NOT included here as it requires special installation
# with --prefer-binary flag and may need C++ build tools on Windows.
# The install.bat script handles this separately with user confirmation.
